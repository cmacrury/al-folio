abstract = {Information gathering by crawlers on the web is of practical interest. We consider a simplified model for crawling complex networks such as the web graph, which is a variation of the robot vacuum edge-cleaning process of Messinger and Nowakowski. In our model, a crawler visits nodes via a deterministic walk determined by their weightings which change during the process deterministically. The minimum, maximum, and average time for the robot crawler to visit all the nodes of a graph is considered on various graph classes such as trees, multi-partite graphs, binomial random graphs, and graphs generated by the preferential attachment model.},

abstract = "Zero forcing is a deterministic iterative graph coloring process in which vertices are colored either blue or white, and in every round, any blue vertices that have a single white neighbor force these white vertices to become blue. Here we study probabilistic zero forcing, where blue vertices have a non-zero probability of forcing each white neighbor to become blue. We explore the propagation time for probabilistic zero forcing on the Erdős–Réyni random graph G(n,p) when we start with a single vertex colored blue. We show that when p=log−o(1)n, then with high probability it takes (1+o(1))log2log2n rounds for all the vertices in G(n,p) to become blue, and when logn∕n≪p≤log−O(1)n, then with high probability it takes Θ(log(1∕p)) rounds."
